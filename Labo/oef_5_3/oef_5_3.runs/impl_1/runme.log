WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net design_1_i/statemachine_0/U0/NS is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/statemachine_0/U0/Z_reg_i_2/O, cell design_1_i/statemachine_0/U0/Z_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
